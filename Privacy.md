**Privacy Policy for M1bot**

This Privacy Policy governs the collection, use, and sharing of personal information by M1bot, a Discord bot developed and maintained by @M1hunter09. By using M1bot, you agree to the terms outlined in this policy.

**Information We Collect**

M1bot may collect and process the following data, depending on which features you use:

• User Data: Discord user ID, username, and avatar (for features like tickets, XP, moderation, etc.).
• Server & Channel Data: Server ID, channel ID, and names where the bot operates.
• Message Content: Only if needed for certain features (e.g., ticket creation or logging, depending on your server’s setup).
• Usage Data: Command usage, feature access logs, or timestamps for debugging and improvements.

We do **not** log or store message content unless it's directly related to a feature like ticketing or moderation, and only when absolutely necessary.

How We Use Your Information
Your information is used to:

• Operate and provide core M1bot functionality
• Respond to commands and automate server features
• Improve and debug the bot
• Comply with Discord’s policies and community standards
• Handle abuse reports or technical issues

**Sharing Your Information**

We do **not** sell, rent, or share your information with any third parties.
We may share data only when required by law or by Discord Trust & Safety for moderation or abuse concerns.

**Data Retention**

We keep data only as long as needed for bot functionality and performance. For example:

• Ticket data may be stored temporarily until the ticket is closed
• XP and level data are stored persistently until reset by server admins
• Logs or analytics (if any) are used internally for debugging

You may request deletion of your data at any time — see the Contact Us section below.

**Data Security**

We take reasonable steps to protect your data. However, no system is 100% secure. Use of M1bot is at your own discretion, and by using it, you agree to these terms.

**Changes to This Policy**
We may update this Privacy Policy over time. When we do, we’ll announce changes in the Discord support server and/or via GitHub, if applicable. Continued use of M1bot after changes means you accept the updated terms.
