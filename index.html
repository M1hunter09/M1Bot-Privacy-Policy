  <h2>1. Information We Collect</h2>
  <p>M1bot may collect and process the following data, depending on which features you use:

• User Data: Discord user ID, username, and avatar (for features like tickets, XP, moderation, etc.).
• Server & Channel Data: Server ID, channel ID, and names where the bot operates.
• Message Content: Only if needed for certain features (e.g., ticket creation or logging, depending on your server’s setup).
• Usage Data: Command usage, feature access logs, or timestamps for debugging and improvements.

We do not log or store message content unless it's directly related to a feature like ticketing or moderation, and only when absolutely necessary.

Your information is used to:

• Operate and provide core M1bot functionality
• Respond to commands and automate server features
